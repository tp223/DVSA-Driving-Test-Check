# DVSA-Driving-Test-Check
A simple Python bot which will send you an email when driving test cancellations become available at the selected test center.

## Cloud Version
We have deployed this application to our new site https://www.copadrivingtest.co.uk so that you can get driving test cancellations for only £9.99 per licence. This includes checks every few minutes and test reservations with bookings made on request automatically. We would love your feedback so please get in touch wih any ideas.

## About
Due to current high demand for driving tests I have built a simple python script which will quickly check the driving test booking page for any available tests and email you if there are any free. It is also free to use and fairly simple, just put your current test in to the script file and it will do the rest for you.

## Configuration
1) Enter your details into both scripts
2) Place the launchDVSA.py file on your desktop for easy access
3) Schedule a task to run the script regularly (10 minutes is ideal to stop the application locking you out)
4) Run launchDVSA.py to quickly login with a single click and to confirm booking

## Limitations
- Does not detect specific tests. It will only notify you if there is a test availabe at the chosen center
- Continually send emails if there are tests available but no changes from previous check
